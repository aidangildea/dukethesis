Main idea: What you should do in addition to what this package allows?

## Colorblind Accessibility Best Practices

-   importance of text

    -   using hyperlegible font

    -   ensuring its size is appropriate

        -   scaling it to the rest of the visualization, rather than manually setting so it is appropriate per use

    -   use of background colors, lines

        -   clean minimal design allows for things most important to be visible

    -   limiting the number of colors to 8 in discrete case

        -   best practice when it comes to readable graphs

    -   describe things not neccessarily addressed in thesis but other best practices to be aware of

        -   categories

        -   type of data
