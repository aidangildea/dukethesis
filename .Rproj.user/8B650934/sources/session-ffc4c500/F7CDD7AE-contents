# Introduction

In nearly all disciplines, there is an increasing push to promote accessibility. Data visualization should be no different. The goal of this book is to detail the motivations, development, and use of the ***duke*** package. By the end of "Promoting Accessibility in Duke Data Visualization," you should be sufficiently informed on how to create official Duke visualizations in a colorblind friendly way.
